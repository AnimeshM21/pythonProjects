<h1>Python Projects</h1>
<h2>All the projects updated here are either self-projects or part of a courses that I'm taking.</h3>

<p>When learning to code in any language it is essential to build projects using the language to gain practical experience. That is exactly what I'm trying to do here with this repositiry. Looking to start with simple projects and then move on to much more complex and real-world application based projects. Much more is coming, can't wait for it!!!</p>
